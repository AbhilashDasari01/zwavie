# 🎧 ZWAVIE — Beat Responsive Audio Visualizer

**ZWAVIE** is a real-time, neon-styled audio frequency visualizer built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It transforms live microphone input or audio playback into stunning visuals synced with frequency bands — sub-bass waves, bass circles, midrange bars, and shimmering highs.

ZWAVIE was built out of a desire for a customizable and aesthetically powerful visualizer for music lovers, streamers, and creative coders. It draws inspiration from analog audio equipment and synthwave visuals.
